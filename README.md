# NYT-React
Single page MERN application to search and save New York Times articles. Uses MongoDB, Mongoose ORM, Node, Express and React.

This is a full stack news application which allows users to search, view and save New York Times articles.

3) Remove saved articles from the database.

Finally, the user can click on any article headline and a new page will open which follows the link for the headline.
